# Shraddha ERP Partner Challenge

## Overview
We are selecting the next Laravel + Vue partner for Shraddha Media Network's donation management platform and future ERP modules. Review the dummy project, then tell us your price, delivery time, portfolio, and team strength. Only shortlisted teams will be asked to build the sample app so we can measure quality before awarding long-term work.

Shraddha Media Network is looking for a team or a couple of teams to continue an existing ERP project built with Laravel + Vue. This dummy project request is the first stage of that selection process, and shortlisted teams from this stage may be chosen to continue the ERP project.

## What You Need to Submit
- Price range and delivery timeline for the dummy project.
- Team information: roles, years of experience, and relevant certifications.
- Laravel + Vue fullstack portfolio links or case studies.
- Approach to testing and documentation.

## Important Notice
Do not start any development work without a written request from Shraddha Media Network. Only selected teams will be invited to build the dummy project, and payment will be made after the complete project is submitted and verified against the stated criteria.

## Details
See the full specification and requirements in [DUMMY_PROJECT.md](DUMMY_PROJECT.md).
